# Live Location GPS Tracker
The Live Location GPS Tracker project combines Arduino Uno, SIM800L, and GPS Neo 6M modules to track and send location data to a designated API. The Arduino Uno serves as the microcontroller, while the SIM800L module provides the cellular communication capabilities. The GPS Neo 6M module is responsible for acquiring the GPS location coordinates.

The script is designed to read the GPS location data from the GPS Neo 6M module and send it to the API endpoint using the SIM800L module.
